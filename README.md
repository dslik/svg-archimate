Beginnings of a library that creates ArchiMate® style diagrams from a text specification file similar to https://sequencediagram.org.

Final goal is to be able to include diagrams as inline text in markdown documents, so that the text describing the diagram can be tracked using standard GitHub-style change tracking.

Implementation based on the ArchiMate® 3.0.1 Specification book, ISBN 978-94-018-0236-9. ArchiMate® is a trademarks of The Open Group.
